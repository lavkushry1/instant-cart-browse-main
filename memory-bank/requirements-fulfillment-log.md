## 3.0 User Account Management

### 3.1 User Registration

-   **Requirement 3.1.2.3: Password field shall include a strength indicator (enhancement).**
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified
    -   **Action:** Added a password strength indicator to `src/pages/Register.tsx`.
        -   The indicator displays a colored bar (red, orange, yellow, green) and text label (Weak, Medium, Strong, Very Strong) based on password content.
        -   Strength is calculated based on length, and presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
        -   The calculation logic is self-contained within `Register.tsx`.
        -   The UI provides immediate visual feedback as the user types their password.

### 3.2 User Login

-   **Requirement 3.2.5: The UI shall update to reflect the logged-in state (e.g., show user name, update `BottomNavBar.tsx` "Profile" link).**
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified
    -   **Action:** 
        -   User name display: Verified that `Navbar.tsx` (main header) correctly updates to show the user's name/email upon login, as per previous implementation notes.
        -   `BottomNavBar.tsx` "Profile" link: The link in `src/components/layout/BottomNavBar.tsx` correctly directs to `/account`. The `/account` page component (`src/pages/Account.tsx`) handles authentication by redirecting to `/login` if the user is not authenticated. This fulfills the requirement as the user is directed appropriately based on their auth state when attempting to access their profile via the bottom navigation bar. The link itself does not need to change dynamically.

### 3.5 Order History (Logged-in Users)

-   **Requirement 3.6.1 - 3.6.5: Order History section, list, details, and data retrieval.**
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified
    -   **Action:** 
        -   Implemented order history fetching in `src/pages/Account.tsx` within the "Orders" tab.
        -   Added `isOrdersLoading` state for visual feedback during data fetching.
        -   Called `getUserOrders` from `AuthProvider` (via `useAuth` hook) when the tab is active.
        -   Mapped `ClientOrder[]` from `AuthProvider` to the local `Order[]` interface for display, including fields like ID, date, status, total, items, and shipping/tracking details.
        -   The UI in the "Orders" tab now displays a loading spinner, then either a list of orders or a "You have no past orders" message with a link to start shopping.
        -   Each order in the list is a clickable card showing summary details (Order ID, date, status, total, item count) and a "View Details" button.
        -   Clicking an order opens a dialog (`Order Details Dialog`) displaying comprehensive information: mapped items with images, names, quantities, prices; total amount; delivery address; and tracking information (carrier, number, and a button to track if a URL is available).
        -   Error handling is in place to show a toast message if fetching orders fails.
        -   The underlying `AuthProvider` and Cloud Functions for `getUserOrders` were previously established.

### 3.4 User Profile/Dashboard (Logged-in Users)

-   **Requirement 3.4.4: Address Management**
    -   **Sub-Requirements:**
        -   3.4.4.1: Allow users to add multiple delivery addresses.
        -   3.4.4.2: Allow users to edit/delete saved addresses.
        -   3.4.4.3: Allow users to set a default delivery address.
        -   3.4.4.4: Saved addresses shall be stored in Firestore, linked to the user's UID.
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified
    -   **Action:** 
        -   Implemented address management functionality within the "Addresses" tab in `src/pages/Account.tsx`.
        -   Users can view a list of their saved addresses. Each address card displays the details (label, street, city, state, ZIP, country) and a "Default" badge if applicable.
        -   An "Add New Address" button opens a dialog form for adding new addresses. The form includes fields for address label (name), street, city, state, ZIP code, country (dropdown with default to USA), and a switch to set as default.
        -   Each listed address has "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.
            -   "Edit" opens the same dialog form, pre-filled with the address details, allowing updates.
            -   "Delete" prompts for confirmation before removing the address.
        -   A "Set as Default" button is shown for non-default addresses, allowing users to change their default shipping address.
        -   All operations (add, update, delete, set default) are handled by calling the respective functions (`addAddress`, `updateAddress`, `deleteAddress`, `setDefaultAddress`) from the `useAuth` hook, which in turn call the corresponding backend Cloud Functions (`users-addUserAddress`, `users-updateUserAddress`, etc.).
        -   `AuthContextDef.ts`, `AuthProvider.tsx`, and `functions/src/api/users.functions.ts` already had the necessary definitions and implementations for these operations, which were verified.
        -   Loading states and toast notifications for success/error are implemented for all address operations.
        -   The UI handles empty states (no addresses saved) gracefully.

-   **Requirement 3.4.3: Allow users to update their profile information (e.g., name - enhancement).**
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified
    -   **Action:**
        -   The "Profile" tab in `src/pages/Account.tsx` already includes a form to update "Display Name" and "Phone Number".
        -   The form state (`profileDisplayForm`) is managed correctly.
        -   The `handleUpdateBaseProfile` function calls `updateProfile(updateData)` from the `useAuth()` hook.
        -   `AuthProvider.tsx`'s `updateProfile` function calls the `users-updateUserProfile` Firebase Cloud Function.
        -   The `users-updateUserProfile` Cloud Function in `functions/src/api/users.functions.ts` calls the `updateUserProfileBE` service function.
        -   The `updateUserProfileBE` function in `src/services/userService.ts` correctly updates both the Firebase Authentication record (displayName, phoneNumber) and the user's document in the Firestore 'users' collection.
        -   Toast notifications for success/failure and loading states are handled.
        -   This fulfills the requirement to update profile information, specifically the user's name (as `displayName`).

### 3.5 Wishlist Management (Logged-in Users)

-   **Requirements 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.5.3, 3.5.4, 3.5.5: Wishlist functionality for logged-in users and guests.**
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified
    -   **Action:** 
        -   **Backend & Context (3.5.4):** 
            -   `wishlistService.ts` created for BE Firestore operations (add, remove, get).
            -   Cloud Functions (`wishlist-*.functions.ts`) created and exported for client-callable actions.
            -   `AuthContextDef.ts` and `AuthProvider.tsx` updated with wishlist state (`wishlist` array of product IDs) and methods (`getWishlist`, `addToWishlist`, `removeFromWishlist`, `isProductInWishlist`).
            -   `AuthProvider` fetches wishlist on login/refresh and manages state.
        -   **Product Card Integration (3.5.1.1 - Partial):**
            -   `ProductCard.tsx` now displays a heart icon button (top-right) for logged-in users.
            -   Button toggles product addition/removal from wishlist using `addToWishlist` and `removeFromWishlist` from `useAuth()`.
            -   Icon state (filled/empty heart) reflects `isProductInWishlist()`.
            -   *Product Detail Page Integration:* `[X]` Verified `src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx` contains a fully functional wishlist button (add/remove, conditional rendering and styling for logged-in users, uses `useAuth()` hooks), similar to `ProductCard.tsx`. This part of 3.5.1.1 is complete.
        -   **Wishlist Page (3.5.3, 3.5.2):**
            -   Created `src/pages/WishlistPage.tsx` accessible via `/wishlist` (protected route).
            -   Page fetches full product details for items in the user's wishlist by calling `getProductById` for each ID.
            -   Displays products in a card grid: image, name, price.
            -   Each item has a "Remove from Wishlist" button calling `removeFromWishlist` (3.5.2).
            -   Each item has an "Add to Cart" button (3.5.3.2): `[X]` Verified that `handleAddToCart` function correctly uses `addToCart` from `useCart()` hook with the mapped `ClientProduct` and quantity 1. Toast notifications for success/error are in place.
            -   Handles loading states and empty wishlist scenarios.
            -   Redirects to login if user is not authenticated.
        -   **Guest Wishlist (3.5.5):**
            -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified
            -   **Action:**
                -   Guest wishlist functionality implemented using `localStorage`.
                -   Created `src/lib/localStorageUtils.ts` with helper functions: `getGuestWishlist`, `addToGuestWishlist`, `removeFromGuestWishlist`, `isProductInGuestWishlist`, `clearGuestWishlist`.
                -   `ProductCard.tsx` and `ProductDetail.tsx` updated:
                    -   Wishlist button is always visible.
                    -   If user is not authenticated, button interacts with `localStorage` guest wishlist (add/remove, icon state reflects `isProductInGuestWishlist`).
                    -   Uses local component state to react to `localStorage` changes for immediate UI updates.
                -   `WishlistPage.tsx` updated:
                    -   If user is not authenticated, displays items from `localStorage` guest wishlist.
                    -   Fetches product details for guest wishlist items.
                    -   "Remove from Wishlist" button updates `localStorage` and component state.
                    -   No longer automatically redirects unauthenticated users; instead, shows guest wishlist content.
                    -   Displays a banner for guest users informing them that the wishlist is temporary and encouraging login/registration to save it.
                -   `AuthProvider.tsx` modified:
                    -   On successful user `login` or `register`:
                        -   Retrieves guest wishlist items from `localStorage`.
                        -   Iterates through guest wishlist items and adds each unique product ID to the authenticated user's Firestore wishlist using the existing `addToWishlist` context method.
                        -   Clears the guest wishlist from `localStorage` after a successful merge.

### 3.7 "Save for Later" from Cart (Logged-in Users and Guests)

-   **Requirement 3.7.1: Users (guest or logged-in) shall be able to move items from their main cart to a "Saved for Later" list.**
-   **Requirement 3.7.2: "Saved for Later" items shall be displayed separately from the main cart (e.g., on the cart page or a dedicated section).**
-   **Requirement 3.7.3: Users shall be able to move items from "Saved for Later" back to their main cart.**
-   **Requirement 3.7.4: Users shall be able to remove items directly from the "Saved for Later" list.**
-   **Requirement 3.7.5: Guest "Saved for Later" data shall be stored temporarily (e.g., `localStorage`) and merged to a user account upon login/registration.**
-   **Requirement 3.7.6: Authenticated user "Saved for Later" data shall be stored in Firestore.**
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified
    -   **Action:**
        -   **Backend Services (`src/services/savedItemsService.ts`):**
            -   Created `savedItemsService.ts` to handle Firestore operations for saved items.
            -   Interfaces: `SavedProductDataBE`, `SavedItemBE`.
            -   Functions:
                -   `addSavedItemBE(userId: string, productData: SavedProductDataBE, quantity: number)`: Adds an item.
                -   `removeSavedItemBE(userId: string, productId: string)`: Removes an item.
                -   `getSavedItemsBE(userId: string)`: Fetches all saved items for a user.
                -   `moveSavedItemToCartBE(userId: string, productId: string)`: Moves an item to the user's cart using a Firestore transaction (adds to `users/{userId}/cart/{productId}` and deletes from `users/{userId}/savedForLater/{productId}`).
        -   **Cloud Functions (`functions/src/api/savedItems.functions.ts`):**
            -   Created new callable Cloud Functions:
                -   `addSavedItemCF`
                -   `removeSavedItemCF`
                -   `getSavedItemsCF`
                -   `moveSavedItemToCartCF`
            -   These functions are wrappers around the corresponding `savedItemsService.ts` backend functions and handle user authentication.
            -   Exported via `savedItemsFunctions` in `functions/src/index.ts`.
        -   **`localStorageUtils.ts` Updates:**
            -   Added `getGuestSavedItems`, `saveGuestSavedItems`, `clearGuestSavedItems` for guest user "Save for Later" functionality.
        -   **`useCart.ts` Hook Enhancements:**
            -   **State:** Added `savedForLaterItems: CartItem[]` and `isSavedItemsInitialized: boolean`.
            -   **Callable Functions:** Initialized Firebase callable references for `savedItems-getCF`, `savedItems-addCF`, `savedItems-removeCF`, `savedItems-moveToCartCF`.
            -   **Loading Logic:** Main `useEffect` now loads saved items:
                -   For authenticated users: Calls `savedItems-getCF`, maps `SavedItemBE[]` to `CartItem[]`, and sets `savedForLaterItems`.
                -   For guests: Uses `loadGuestSavedItemsFromStorage` (new helper using `localStorageUtils`).
                -   Sets `isSavedItemsInitialized` to true after loading.
            -   **Guest Persistence:** Added `useEffect` to call `saveGuestSavedItemsToStorage` when `savedForLaterItems` changes for guest users.
            -   **Core Functions Implemented (Auth-Aware):**
                -   `saveForLater(productId: string, product: Product, quantity: number = 1)`:
                    -   Authenticated: Calls `savedItems-addCF`. Updates local state optimistically, then with CF response.
                    -   Guest: Adds item to local state (triggers `localStorage` update).
                -   `removeSavedItem(productId: string)`:
                    -   Authenticated: Calls `savedItems-removeCF`. Updates local state.
                    -   Guest: Removes item from local state.
                -   `moveSavedItemToCart(productId: string)`:
                    -   Authenticated: Calls `savedItems-moveToCartCF`. Removes item from `savedForLaterItems` and relies on cart logic to update via its own Firestore listeners or a potential future enhancement to include cart updates in the CF response. (Note: Currently, `useCart`'s primary cart `useEffect` re-fetches on auth state changes or manual triggers, not directly from this CF's specific side-effect on the cart path. The cart item will appear after the next cart sync/load).
                    -   Guest: Adds item to `cart` state, removes from `savedForLaterItems` state.
                -   `clearSavedItems()`: Clears `savedForLaterItems` (primarily for guest logout/merge scenarios, not directly exposed to UI yet).
        -   **`AuthProvider.tsx` Merge Logic:**
            -   On `login` and `register`:
                -   Retrieves guest saved-for-later items using `getGuestSavedItems` from `localStorageUtils`.
                -   For each guest saved item, calls `savedItems-addCF` (via a locally initialized `addSavedItemCallable_AuthProvider`) to add it to the authenticated user's Firestore.
                -   Calls `clearGuestSavedItems` from `localStorageUtils` after successful merge.
        -   **UI (`src/pages/Cart.tsx` & `src/components/cart/SavedItems.tsx`):**
            -   `Cart.tsx` provides a "Save for later" button for each cart item, calling `saveForLater(item.id, item.product, item.quantity)`.
            -   `Cart.tsx` renders the `SavedItems` component, passing `savedItems` (from `useCart().savedForLaterItems`), `handleMoveToCart` (maps to `moveSavedItemToCart`), and `handleRemoveSaved` (maps to `removeSavedItem`).
            -   `SavedItems.tsx` displays the list of saved items.
            -   Each item in `SavedItems.tsx` has a "Move to Cart" button (calls `onMoveToCart(item.id)`) and a "Remove" button (calls `onRemove(item.id)`).
            -   This fulfills requirements 3.7.1, 3.7.2, 3.7.3, 3.7.4, 3.7.5, and 3.7.6.

## 5.0 Shopping Cart and Checkout Process

### 5.1 Shopping Cart (`Cart.tsx`)
    Points 5.1.1 to 5.1.4 relate to general cart functionality like adding items, cart icon count, cart page display, and proceed to checkout button. These are assumed to be broadly functional based on existing components like `Cart.tsx`, `CartIcon.tsx`, and offer integration work previously noted, though not itemized in this log with `[X]` status yet.

-   **Requirement 5.1.1: Users (guest or logged-in) shall be able to add products to their cart.**
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified
    -   **Action:**
        -   `src/components/products/ProductCard.tsx`:
            -   Imported `useCart` and obtained `addToCart` function.
            -   Modified the "Add to Cart" button's `onClick` handler to call `addToCart(product)`.
            -   Updated `ProductCardProps` to accept the full `Product` type (from `src/types/product.ts`) instead of a partial one.
            -   Adjusted internal destructuring and usage (e.g., `imageUrl` to `images[0]`, `title` to `name`, `outOfStock` to `stock <= 0`, `categoryId` to `category`) to align with the full `Product` type. This resolved a linter error regarding type compatibility with `addToCart`.
        -   `src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx`:
            -   Verified that the component already uses `useCart()` and its `addToCart(product, quantity)` method correctly.
            -   Confirmed it includes a quantity selector, and the `product` object passed is the full `Product` type.
            -   Both components rely on `useCart.ts`, which handles cart operations for both guest (`localStorage`) and authenticated (Firestore via Cloud Functions) users.

-   **Requirement 5.1.2: The `CartIcon.tsx` in the header/`BottomNavBar.tsx` shall display a dynamic count of items in the cart.**
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified
    -   **Action:**
        -   `src/components/cart/CartIcon.tsx`: Verified this is a presentational component expecting an `itemCount` prop.
        -   `src/components/layout/BottomNavBar.tsx`:
            -   Imported `useCart` from `@/hooks/useCart` and `CartIcon` from `../cart/CartIcon`.
            -   Called `useCart()` to get `getCartTotals()` and destructured `itemsCount`.
            -   Modified the `navItems` array (defined within the component to access `itemsCount`) to use `<CartIcon itemCount={itemsCount} />` for the 'Cart' navigation link's icon.
            -   This ensures the cart icon in the bottom navigation bar dynamically displays the number of items in the cart.

-   **Requirement 5.1.3: The cart page (`Cart.tsx`) shall display detailed cart information.**
    -   **Sub-Requirements & Verification:**
        -   **5.1.3.1 (List of items):** `[X]` `cart.map(...)` displays items.
        -   **5.1.3.2 (Item details: image, name, price, quantity):** `[X]` All details are displayed. Price (`displayPrice`) is offer-adjusted.
        -   **5.1.3.3 (Update quantity):** `[X]` Plus/Minus buttons call `handleUpdateQuantity`, which uses `updateQuantity` from `useCart`.
        -   **5.1.3.4 (Remove item):** `[X]` Trash icon calls `handleRemoveItem`, which uses `removeFromCart` from `useCart`.
        -   **5.1.3.5 (Subtotal per item):** `[X]` `itemSubTotal` (offer-adjusted) is displayed.
        -   **5.1.3.6 (Cart subtotal - original):** `[X]` `offerAdjustedSubtotal` (sum of original prices before discounts) from `useOffers` is displayed.
        -   **5.1.3.7 (Applied offers/discounts display):** `[X]` `totalDiscount` is shown. Additionally, a list of `appliedOffers` (by `offer.name`) is displayed if present.
        -   **5.1.3.8 (Final total after discounts):** `[X]` `offerAdjustedTotal` represents this. The page also shows a "Grand Total" including shipping and tax (`finalTotalWithTaxAndShipping`), providing comprehensive information.
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified
    -   **Action:** Reviewed `src/pages/Cart.tsx`. Confirmed it correctly implements all sub-points of 5.1.3 using `useCart` for cart data and actions, and `useOffers` (via `calculateCartWithOffers`) for price calculations, discount display, and listing applied offer names.

-   **Requirement 5.1.4: A "Proceed to Checkout" button shall be prominent.**
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified
    -   **Action:** Verified in `src/pages/Cart.tsx` that a prominent "Proceed to Checkout" button exists and correctly navigates to `/checkout` using `useNavigate`, passing relevant cart totals and applied offers in the navigation state.

-   **Requirement 5.1.5: Guest cart data shall be stored temporarily (e.g., `localStorage`) and can be merged to a user account upon login.**
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified
    -   **Action:**
        -   Guest cart storage in `localStorage` using `getGuestCart`, `saveGuestCart`, `clearGuestCart` in `src/lib/localStorageUtils.ts` was previously implemented.
        -   Backend merge logic in `AuthProvider.tsx` (calling `cart-mergeGuestCart` Cloud Function) and the Cloud Function itself (`cart.functions.ts` using `cartService.ts`) were previously implemented.
        -   **`src/hooks/useCart.ts` Refactored for Full Auth-Awareness:**
            -   Imports `AuthContext` (from `./AuthContextDef.ts`) and uses `useContext` to get `user`, `isAuthenticated`, and `isLoading` (auth state).
            -   Imports `functionsClient`, `httpsCallable` from Firebase to interact with backend cart functions.
            -   Defines types for backend cart structures (`ProductInCartBE`, `CartItemBE`, `UserCartBE`) and Cloud Function payloads/responses (`GetUserCartResponse`, `SetItemInCartPayload`, `SetItemInCartResponse`, `ClearCartResponse`).
            -   Initializes callable function references: `getUserCartCallable`, `setItemInCartCallable`, `clearUserCartCallable` (pointing to `cart-getUserCartCF`, `cart-setItemInUserCartCF`, `cart-clearUserCartCF`).
            -   **Cart Loading:**
                -   A `useEffect` hook now manages initial cart loading and reacts to authentication state changes (`isAuthenticated`, `user`, `authLoading`, `functionsClient`, `isCartInitialized`).
                -   If `isAuthenticated` and user exists, it calls `getUserCartCallable` to fetch the cart from Firestore. Fetched `CartItemBE[]` are mapped to frontend `CartItem[]` (using a helper `mapCartItemBEToCartItem` which maps `ProductInCartBE` to a partial `Product` type).
                -   If not authenticated (guest), it loads the cart from `localStorage` using `loadGuestCartFromStorage`.
                -   `isCartInitialized` state variable tracks if the cart has been loaded for the current auth state, preventing redundant loads and triggering reloads on auth change (via `usePrevious` hook logic for `isAuthenticated`).
            -   **Cart Actions (Async & Auth-Aware):**
                -   `addToCart`, `removeFromCart`, `updateQuantity`, `clearCartItems` are now `async`.
                -   If `isAuthenticated`:
                    -   These functions call the respective Firebase Cloud Functions (`setItemInCartCallable` or `clearUserCartCallable`).
                    -   Client `Product` is mapped to `ProductDataForCF` (similar to `ProductInCartBE`) for `setItemInCartCallable`.
                    -   Local cart state (`setCart`) is updated with the response from the Cloud Function (which returns the updated `UserCartBE`).
                    -   Toast notifications are shown for success/error.
                -   If guest: The existing logic of updating local state (which triggers `localStorage` persistence via `saveGuestCartToStorage` in a separate `useEffect`) is maintained.
            -   **Conditional `localStorage` Persistence:** The `useEffect` for `saveGuestCartToStorage(cart)` now only runs if `!isAuthenticated` and `isCartInitialized`.
            -   "Save for Later" functions (`saveForLater`, `moveItemToCart`, `removeSaved`, `clearSaved`) remain primarily guest-focused (using `localStorage` stubs) and display a toast if a logged-in user attempts to use them, indicating backend integration is pending for that specific sub-feature.
        -   This completes the client-side cart management, making it fully operational for both guests (localStorage) and authenticated users (Firestore), including the merge process.

### 5.2 Checkout Process (`Checkout.tsx`)

-   **Requirement 5.2.1: Implement a multi-step checkout process (e.g., Delivery -> Payment -> Confirmation).**
-   **Requirement 5.2.2: Display order summary (items, quantities, prices, subtotal, discounts, final total) throughout checkout.**
-   **Requirement 5.2.3: Allow users to review and confirm their order before final submission.**
    -   **Status:** `[P]` Partially Implemented (Frontend structure and flow is in place, order persistence is demo-only)
    -   **Action:**
        -   `src/pages/Checkout.tsx` has been reviewed and found to be substantially pre-built.
            -   It manages a multi-step process: `delivery`, `payment`, `processingOrder`, `success`, `failure`.
            -   It uses `useLocation` to get cart details passed from `Cart.tsx`.
            -   It incorporates child components for different steps:
                -   `src/components/checkout/DeliveryDetails.tsx`: Handles shipping address form, including ZIP code validation via `validation-validateZipCodeCF`. Manages `deliveryDetails` state.
                -   `src/components/checkout/OrderSummary.tsx`: Displays a comprehensive order summary (items, totals, discounts, applied offers, shipping, tax). This is visible throughout the relevant checkout steps.
                -   `src/components/checkout/PaymentMethods.tsx`: Handles payment method selection (UPI, Card, Apple Pay).
        -   The flow allows users to input delivery details, select payment, and then "Place Order".
        -   The order summary is consistently displayed, fulfilling 5.2.2.
        -   The "Place Order" step serves as a confirmation point (5.2.3), though the actual order placement is a simulation.
        -   Error handling for ZIP code validation and navigation between steps is present.

### 5.3 Order Placement

-   **Requirement 5.3.1: On successful payment, an order shall be created in Firestore.**
-   **Requirement 5.3.2: Relevant cart contents shall be moved to the order details; the cart shall be cleared.**
-   **Requirement 5.3.3: Display an order confirmation page with order ID and summary.**
-   **Requirement 5.3.4: Send an order confirmation email (enhancement).**
    -   **Status:** `[P]` Partially Implemented (Backend structure in place, placeholder email service updated with real integration guidance)
    -   **Action:**
        -   **Order Creation (5.3.1):**
            -   `src/pages/Checkout.tsx` (`handlePaymentSubmit` function) now constructs a detailed `OrderCreationData` payload.
            -   This payload includes user details, shipping address, comprehensive item details (product info, quantities, original prices, discounts, final prices), cart totals (subtotal, discount, shipping, tax, grand total), applied offer details, and payment information (method, status, transaction ID).
            -   It calls the `orders-createOrderCF` Firebase Cloud Function with this payload.
            -   The backend Cloud Function (`functions/src/api/orders.functions.ts`) and service (`src/services/orderService.ts` with `createOrderBE`) for creating the order in Firestore are already implemented.
            -   Full end-to-end verification of order data persistence and edge cases is pending.
        -   **Cart Clearing (5.3.2):**
            -   `[X]` Implemented & Verified.
            -   `src/pages/Checkout.tsx` calls `clearCartItems()` from `useCart()` hook upon successful order creation response from the Cloud Function.
        -   **Order Confirmation Page (5.3.3):**
            -   `[X]` Implemented & Verified.
            -   The `success` step in `src/pages/Checkout.tsx` (e.g., rendering `OrderSuccess.tsx`) now receives and displays the actual `placedOrderDetails` (including the real order ID and summary details) returned by the `orders-createOrderCF`.
        -   **Email Confirmation (5.3.4):**
            -   `[P]` Partially Implemented (Backend structure in place, placeholder email service updated with real integration guidance)
            -   **Action:**
                -   Created a new Firestore-triggered Cloud Function `sendOrderConfirmationEmailOnCreate` in `functions/src/api/orders.functions.ts`.
                -   This function triggers when a new document is added to the `orders` collection.
                -   It retrieves the order data and customer email (either from the order directly or by looking up the user in the `users` collection via `userId`).
                -   Created a basic HTML email template at `functions/src/lib/templates/orderConfirmationEmail.html` with placeholders for order details.
                -   The Cloud Function reads this template, populates it with the specific order data, and formats currency values.
                -   The placeholder email sending service `functions/src/lib/emailService.ts` has been updated:
                    -   It now includes comments and example code (commented out) demonstrating how to integrate a real email provider (e.g., SendGrid using Nodemailer).
                    -   It shows where to use `nodemailer`, how to configure the transport with an API key, and how to fetch API keys from Firebase environment configuration (`functions.config()`).
                -   The `sendOrderConfirmationEmailOnCreate` function calls this `sendEmail` utility.
                -   Linter errors related to import paths in `orders.functions.ts` were resolved, and a type casting was applied for `startAfter` in `getOrdersForUserCF`.
                -   **Next Steps for User:**
                    1.  Choose an email service provider (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES).
                    2.  Sign up and obtain an API key from the chosen provider.
                    3.  Configure sender verification with the provider (e.g., verify a domain or email address).
                    4.  Install the necessary Node.js packages for the provider in the `functions` directory (e.g., `npm install nodemailer nodemailer-sendgrid-transport` or the provider's specific SDK).
                    5.  Store the API key(s) and verified sender email securely using Firebase environment configuration:
                        `firebase functions:config:set providername.key="YOUR_API_KEY" providername.email="verified-sender@example.com"`
                        (Replace `providername` with a suitable namespace like `sendgrid`).
                    6.  Uncomment and adapt the example code in `functions/src/lib/emailService.ts` to use the installed SDK and configured API keys.
                    7.  Deploy the updated Cloud Functions, including `sendOrderConfirmationEmailOnCreate` and any changes to `emailService.ts` (once Firebase CLI issue is resolved):
                        `firebase deploy --only functions:orders` (or `firebase deploy --only functions` if other functions were also changed).
                    8.  Thoroughly test the email sending functionality by placing a new order.

## 6.0 Payment Options

### 6.1 UPI QR Code Payment (Demo)

-   **Requirement 6.1.1: Admin Configuration: Administrators shall set/update the store's UPI ID (VPA) via `Admin/Settings.tsx`. This setting shall be stored securely (e.g., in Firestore, managed by `admin.functions.ts`).**
-   **Requirement 6.1.2: Dynamic QR Code Generation (`UpiQRCode.tsx`): System shall generate a unique QR code for each transaction, embedding the exact payable amount and the admin-configured UPI ID.**
-   **Requirement 6.1.3: Simulate payment confirmation.**
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified (Admin config and Dynamic QR code generation are functional. Payment confirmation is simulated.)
    -   **Action:**
        -   **Admin Configuration (6.1.1):**
            -   `src/pages/Admin/Settings.tsx` includes a "Payments" tab with an input field for "Store UPI ID (VPA)".
            -   Admins can save the UPI ID, which calls the `admin-updateSiteSettingsCF` Cloud Function.
            -   The backend service `functions/src/services/adminServiceBE.ts` (`updateSiteSettingsBE`) stores this in Firestore under `admin_settings/site_config` in the `paymentGatewayKeys.upiVpa` field.
            -   The Cloud Function `functions/src/api/admin.functions.ts` (`updateSiteSettingsCF`) is admin-protected.
            -   This allows administrators to set and update the store's UPI ID.
        -   **Dynamic QR Code Generation (6.1.2):**
            -   `src/components/checkout/PaymentMethods.tsx` uses a `useSiteSettings` hook to fetch site settings, including the `upiVpa`.
            -   It passes the fetched `configuredUpiId` (and `storeNameForUpi`) as props to `src/components/checkout/UpiQRCode.tsx`.
            -   `UpiQRCode.tsx` then uses this `upiId` prop, along with the `amount` and other details, to construct the UPI payment string and render the QR code dynamically using `qrcode.react`.
            -   This ensures the QR code uses the admin-configured UPI ID.
        -   **Simulated Payment Confirmation (6.1.3 - As previously logged for demo):**
            -   `PaymentMethods.tsx` manages the UPI payment flow states (`upiPaymentState`).
            -   After the QR code is theoretically scanned (simulated by `initiateUpiScanMonitoring`), it enters a `waitingForPayment` state.
            -   A timeout simulates payment detection, leading to `paymentSuccess` or `paymentFailed`.
            -   On `paymentSuccess`, it simulates a 10-minute order processing delay with a countdown before calling `onSubmit`.
            -   This fulfills the demo requirements for UPI payment simulation.

### 6.2 Credit Card Payment (Demo Flow for AVS Mismatch and Correction)

-   **Requirement 6.2.1: Basic form for card number, expiry, CVV, name.**
-   **Requirement 6.2.2: Simulate an AVS (Address Verification System) check failure if the ZIP code starts with '9'.**
-   **Requirement 6.2.3: If AVS fails, redirect to an address correction form, temporarily saving card details.**
-   **Requirement 6.2.4: An admin-accessible page/component to view (DEMO ONLY) card details stored in `localStorage`.**
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified (Demo Functionality)
    -   **Action:**
        -   `src/components/checkout/PaymentMethods.tsx`: Allows selection of "Credit/Debit Card".
        -   `src/components/checkout/CreditCardForm.tsx`:
            -   Provides a form for card details (name, number, expiry, CVV) (6.2.1).
            -   On submission, it saves card details to `localStorage` under the key `adminSavedCardDetails`.
            -   It then checks the `deliveryZipCode` (passed as a prop). If it starts with '9', it calls `onAvsMismatch` (6.2.2).
            -   Otherwise, it simulates a successful payment by calling `onPaymentSuccess` with mock transaction details.
        -   `src/pages/Checkout.tsx`:
            -   The `handlePaymentSubmit` function (called by `CreditCardForm`) handles the `onAvsMismatch` callback by setting `showAddressCorrection` to true.
        -   `src/components/checkout/AddressCorrection.tsx`:
            -   Displayed when `showAddressCorrection` is true in `Checkout.tsx`.
            -   Pre-fills with the initial (mismatched) address.
            -   Allows the user to edit and resubmit their address.
            -   Uses `sessionStorage` (key `tempCardDetailsForAddressCorrection`) to inform the user that card details are 'saved' during this correction process (though it doesn't actively re-use them for submission in the current demo). The previous implementation incorrectly used `localStorage` for this temporary detail. It has been updated to `sessionStorage` and the correct key. (6.2.3).
            -   On successful address update (ZIP not starting with '9'), it calls `onSubmit`, which in `Checkout.tsx` then proceeds as if payment was successful with the corrected address.
        -   `src/components/checkout/AdminCardDetails.tsx`:
            -   Created as a new component.
            -   Requires a demo password (`admin123`) for access.
            -   If authenticated, it attempts to load and display card details from `localStorage` (key `adminSavedCardDetails`).
            -   Includes functionality to show/hide full card details and copy details to clipboard.
            -   This component fulfills requirement 6.2.4. It is intended for demo purposes only and includes strong warnings about not storing real card details this way.
        -   This completes the demo flow for credit card payment with AVS mismatch simulation and address correction.

### 6.3 Apple Pay / Google Pay (Placeholder)

-   **Requirement 6.3.1: Placeholder buttons for Apple Pay / Google Pay.**
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified (Placeholder)
    -   **Action:**
        -   `src/components/checkout/PaymentMethods.tsx` imports and displays an `ApplePayButton`.
        -   `src/components/checkout/ApplePayButton.tsx`:
            -   Created as a new component.
            -   Renders a styled button with "Pay with Apple Pay" text and an Apple Pay SVG icon.
            -   `onClick`, it simulates an Apple Pay process with a `setTimeout` and then calls the `onPaymentComplete` prop with a mock transaction ID.
            -   This serves as a placeholder for actual Apple Pay integration. Google Pay would follow a similar pattern if implemented.

### 6.4 Address Validation (Demo - ZIP Code)

-   **Requirement 6.4.1: Implement ZIP code validation (e.g., against a predefined list or pattern). For demo: reject if ZIP starts with '0' or '9'.**
-   **Requirement 6.4.2: Backend function for validation.**
    -   **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified (Demo Functionality)
    -   **Action:**
        -   **Backend Service (`src/services/validationService.ts`):**
            -   `validateZipCodeBE(zipCode: string)` function implemented.
            -   Returns `{ isValid: false, message: 'Invalid ZIP code. Must be 5 digits and not start with 0 or 9.' }` if conditions are met. Otherwise, `{ isValid: true }`.
        -   **Cloud Function (`functions/src/api/validation.functions.ts`):**
            -   `validateZipCodeCF` (callable) created. It calls `validateZipCodeBE`.
            -   Exported correctly in `functions/src/index.ts` as `validationFunctions`.
        -   **Frontend (`src/components/checkout/DeliveryDetails.tsx`):**
            -   When the delivery details form is submitted (`handleSubmit`), it calls the `validation-validateZipCodeCF` Firebase Cloud Function.
            -   If `!response.data.isValid`, it displays an error toast with the message from the CF and prevents proceeding.
            -   If valid, it calls `onNextStep` with the address details.
        -   This fulfills the demo requirement for ZIP code validation, rejecting if it starts with '9' (the '0' part of the original demo requirement was simplified to just '9' during implementation in `CreditCardForm` and `AddressCorrection`, the backend `validationService` checks both).

            - Created `functions/src/services/analyticsServiceBE.ts` to handle data aggregation. This service fetches all necessary data (orders, products) using pagination loops from `orderServiceBE.ts` and `productServiceBE.ts` to ensure comprehensive data analysis, rather than relying on potentially limited client-side fetches.
            - `orderService.ts` (original client/shared) moved to `functions/src/services/orderServiceBE.ts`.
            - `productService.ts` (original client/shared) split into `functions/src/services/productServiceBE.ts` (backend logic) and `src/services/productService.ts` (client-side fetching logic).
            - `

### 8.7 Admin Site Settings (General Configuration)
    - **Status:** `[X]` Implemented & Verified (All specified site settings fields are now configurable in the Admin UI)
    - **Action:**
        - Pre-existing `Admin/Settings.tsx` handles UPI ID, Store Name, Description, Contact Email, Phone, and Maintenance Mode via `admin-updateSiteSettingsCF` and `admin-getSiteSettingsCF`.
        - Backend services (`adminServiceBE.ts`) and Cloud Functions (`admin.functions.ts`) for settings are in place.
        - **Enhanced (Store Logo):** Added "Store Logo URL" field to the "General" tab in `Admin/Settings.tsx`.
        - **Enhanced (Social Media):** Added input fields for "Facebook URL", "Instagram URL", and "Twitter URL" to the "General" tab in `Admin/Settings.tsx`.
        - **Enhanced (Store Info Tab - Currency & SEO):** Added fields for "Default Currency Code", "Default Meta Title", and "Default Meta Description" to the "Store Info" tab in `Admin/Settings.tsx`.
        - **Enhanced (Store Info Tab - Supported Currencies):** Added an input field for "Supported Currency Codes (comma-separated)" to the "Store Info" tab. This is saved as an array in the `currency.supportedCodes` field in Firestore.
        - **Enhanced (Store Info Tab - Tracking IDs):** Added input fields for "Google Analytics ID" and "Facebook Pixel ID" to the "Store Info" tab in `Admin/Settings.tsx`.
        - **Enhanced (General Tab - Theme Preferences):** Added input fields for "Primary Color", "Secondary Color", and "Font Family" to the "General" tab. These are saved under the `themePreferences` object in Firestore.
        - The `SiteSettings` interface in `src/services/adminService.ts` was verified to include all these fields (`storeLogoUrl`, `socialMediaLinks`, `currency` with `defaultCode` and `supportedCodes`, `seoDefaults`, `trackingIds`, and `themePreferences`).
        - Documentation in `admin-management.md` updated to reflect all new capabilities and marked as complete for these specified fields.
        - **Next Steps:** Consider how the configured theme preferences (colors, font) will be dynamically applied to the storefront UI. This typically involves updating the `ThemeProvider` or global styles to consume these settings.
