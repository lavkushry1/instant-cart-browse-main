# Implementation Status

This document outlines the current implementation status of features based on the defined project requirements, particularly the detailed e-commerce flow with custom payments.

## Overview

The structural backend (Firebase services and Cloud Functions) is complete and ready for live integration. Frontend implementation for specific custom payment flows and some admin functionalities detailed in the requirements are the next major focus.

## User-Facing E-commerce Flow

### Core Shopping Experience

-   [✅] Guest Cart (Add to cart without login - fundamental requirement)
-   [🟡] Checkout Upsell Display (Display free/discounted items - UI and logic pending)
-   [✅] Delivery Details Collection (Form exists - `Checkout.tsx`)

### UPI QR Payment Flow
-   [🟡] Dynamic QR Code Generation (Frontend to display QR based on admin VPA & amount - UI pending)
-   [🔲] Payment Status Monitoring (Simulated/Actual - logic pending)
-   [🟡] 10-Minute Wait & Dummy Tracking Display (Frontend orchestration pending)

### Credit Card Payment Flow
-   [✅] Card Details Collection Form (`CreditCardForm.tsx` - structure exists)

-   [🟢] **All Backend Services (`offerService.ts`, `productService.ts`, etc.)**: SDK Activated
-   [🟢] **All Cloud Functions (`functions/src/api/*`)**: SDK Activated (wrappers around services)
    **Status: Backend structure and Firebase SDK calls are in place (uncommented). Ready for deployment and live data testing.**

## Design Principles & UX Considerations (Ongoing)
-   [🟡] Clean, Modern UI (Partially implemented, ongoing refinement)
-   [🟡] Mobile-Responsive Design (Partially implemented, ongoing refinement)
-   [🟡] Clear Error Messages & User Guidance (Partially implemented, needs comprehensive review)

## Next Steps & Priorities

1.  **Frontend Implementation for Custom Payment Flows**: Build out the specific UI interactions and logic for:
    *   UPI QR display and (simulated) payment detection.
    *   Credit card address correction data persistence and pre-fill.
    *   Orchestration of 10-minute wait times and transition to dummy tracking for both payment methods.
2.  **Admin Payment Configuration UI**: Frontend for admin to set UPI ID.
3.  **Firebase Live Integration & Testing**: 
    *   Deploy backend services and Cloud Functions to a live Firebase project.
    *   Thoroughly test all backend logic with real data.
    *   Connect frontend to live Cloud Functions.
4.  **Complete Core Admin Panel UIs**: For Products, Orders, Categories, Users.
5.  **Comprehensive Testing**: End-to-end testing of all user journeys and admin functionalities.
6.  **Address UI/UX Refinements & Design Principles**: Systematically review and enhance based on the defined principles.

This status provides a clearer picture based on the detailed requirements and the current state of the backend structure.
