## Backend Implementation Status (Firebase)

## Next Steps & Priorities

1.  **Frontend Implementation for Custom Payment Flows**: Core logic structured.
2.  **Admin Payment Configuration UI**: Done (structurally, pending live CF calls verification).
3.  **Firebase Client SDK Setup & Live Integration**: 
    *   Ensure `src/lib/firebaseClient.ts` is correctly initialized. (User action)
    *   Verify/update deployed Cloud Function names in frontend calls. (User action)
    *   Update `PaymentMethods.tsx` & `useSiteSettings` hook for live CF calls.
    *   **Replace mock CF calls in existing Admin UIs with live `httpsCallable` instances.** (**Current Focus: `Admin/Products.tsx` and `Admin/ProductForm.tsx`**)
    *   Integrate other Admin Panel UIs (e.g., SEO, Theme) and core e-commerce flows (Order placement) to their respective live Cloud Functions.
4.  **Firebase Live Testing**: Deploy backend, test thoroughly with live frontend calls.
5.  **Complete Core Admin Panel UIs**.
6.  **Comprehensive Testing**.
7.  **Address UI/UX Refinements & Design Principles**.

_Current Focus: Replacing mock Cloud Function calls with actual `httpsCallable` structures in Admin Product Management UIs (`Admin/Products.tsx`, `Admin/ProductForm.tsx`)._
