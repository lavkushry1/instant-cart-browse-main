# Implementation Status

This document outlines the current implementation status of features based on the defined project requirements, particularly the detailed e-commerce flow with custom payments.

## Overview

All backend services and Cloud Functions have their Firebase SDK logic "activated" (uncommented). Frontend Admin UI components and core checkout flows are structurally prepared to call these Cloud Functions, generally using `httpsCallable` with mock fallbacks for development until live Firebase deployment and function name verification by the user.

## User-Facing E-commerce Flow

### Core Shopping Experience
-   [✅] Product Browsing
-   [✅] Guest Cart
-   [✅] Checkout Upsell Display (`CheckoutUpsellDisplay.tsx` integrated into `Checkout.tsx`)
-   [✅] Delivery Details Collection (`Checkout.tsx`)

### UPI QR Payment Flow
-   [✅] Dynamic QR Code Generation & Display (`UpiQRCode.tsx`)
-   [✅] Integration into Checkout (`PaymentMethods.tsx`)
-   [✅] Simulated Payment Status Monitoring & UI Feedback (`PaymentMethods.tsx` refined with states, messages, countdown, failure chance)
-   [✅] Simulated 10-Minute Wait & Dummy Tracking Orchestration (Integrated into UPI simulation)

### Credit Card Payment Flow
-   [✅] Card Details Form & Validation (`CreditCardForm.tsx`)
-   [✅] ZIP Code Validation & Address Correction Workflow (Frontend calls backend CF for validation; session storage for card persistence)
    -   [✅] Backend ZIP validation logic (Demo-level logic in `validationService.ts` & `validation.functions.ts` is active and clean)
-   [✅] OTP Verification (Dummy OTP logic in `CreditCardForm.tsx`)
-   [✅] Transaction Pending & 10-Minute Countdown (`CreditCardForm.tsx` internal handling verified)
-   [✅] Dummy Tracking Orchestration (`Checkout.tsx` post-payment transition verified)

### Order Finalization
-   [✅] Order Confirmation Display (`OrderSuccess.tsx` uses Order object)
-   [✅] Order Tracking Display (`OrderTracking.tsx` refined with mock shipment history from Order object)
-   [✅] Order Placement (`Checkout.tsx` calls `orders-createOrderCF` via `httpsCallable` structure with mock fallback)

## Offer Management System
-   [🟢] Backend Service & Cloud Functions (SDK Activated)
-   [✅] Admin Offer Panel UI (`AdminOffersPage.tsx` uses `httpsCallable` structure with mock fallback)
-   [✅] Frontend Offer Context & Integration (`OfferContext.tsx`, `ProductCard.tsx`, `Cart.tsx`, `Checkout.tsx`)
    **Status: Frontend Offer Integration Conceptually Complete. Backend SDK Activated.**

## Admin Management Features

### Payment Configuration
-   [✅] Admin UPI ID Configuration UI (`Admin/Settings.tsx` uses `httpsCallable` structure with mock fallback)
-   [✅] Stored Raw Card Details Access (`AdminCardDetails.tsx` - demo component structure)

### Core E-commerce Admin
-   [🟢] All Core Backend Services (Products, Categories, Orders, Users, Reviews, Admin Settings, Cart) - SDK Activated.
-   [✅] All Core Admin Frontend UIs (`Products`, `ProductForm`, `Categories`, `Orders`, `Customers`, `Reviews`, `Settings`) - Structurally use `httpsCallable` with mock fallbacks where live Firebase client setup is pending.

## Backend Implementation Status (Firebase)
-   [🟢] **Firebase Admin Core (`firebaseAdmin.ts`)**: SDK Activated (User needs to provide service account/config)
-   [🟢] **All Backend Services**: SDK Activated and use live Firebase Admin SDK calls.
-   [🟢] **All Cloud Functions**: SDK Activated and call live backend services.
    **Status: Entire backend (services + CFs) is structured with live Firebase SDK calls, ready for user's Firebase project config, deployment, and testing.**

## Next Steps & Priorities

1.  **USER ACTION: Firebase Project Setup & Configuration**:
    *   Set up Firebase Project, enable Firestore, Authentication, Functions, Storage.
    *   Update `src/lib/firebaseClient.ts` with actual Firebase web app config keys.
    *   Configure `src/lib/firebaseAdmin.ts` for deployment environment (e.g., service account for local testing if needed, or ensure CF environment provides default credentials).
2.  **USER ACTION: Deploy Cloud Functions** to their Firebase project.
3.  **USER ACTION: Verify & Update Deployed Cloud Function Names**: Ensure names used in `httpsCallable(functionsClient, 'deployed-function-name')` in all frontend files precisely match the deployed function names.
4.  **Frontend Live Integration & Testing (Developer Task after User Actions 1-3)**:
    *   Systematically replace mock fallbacks with live `httpsCallable` calls in Admin UIs and core flows.
    *   Test each feature end-to-end with the live Firebase backend.
    *   Refine `useSiteSettings` hook for live data.
    *   Implement robust, non-simulated UPI payment status checks (requires backend/webhook integration - currently simulated).
    *   If required, implement production-grade backend ZIP validation (currently demo logic).
    *   Finalize data flow for `OrderTracking.tsx` with live order data.
5.  **Complete & Polish UI/UX**: Address any remaining UI tasks, ensure all Design Principles are met, conduct accessibility review, and refine user experience based on testing.
6.  **Comprehensive E2E Testing**.

_Current Status: All planned structural coding for backend and frontend integration points (with live SDK calls in backend, and `httpsCallable` structures with mocks in frontend) is complete. The project is now at a hand-off point for the user to perform Firebase project setup, deployment, and then begin the live integration testing and refinement phase._
