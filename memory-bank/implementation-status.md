# Implementation Status

This document outlines the current implementation status of features based on the defined project requirements, particularly the detailed e-commerce flow with custom payments.

## Overview

...

## User-Facing E-commerce Flow

### Core Shopping Experience
-   [âœ…] Product Browsing
-   [âœ…] Guest Cart
-   [âœ…] **Checkout Upsell Display** (`CheckoutUpsellDisplay.tsx` component created and integrated into `Checkout.tsx`; `onAddUpsellToCart` callback implemented to add items to main cart via `useCart` - **Done**)
-   [âœ…] Delivery Details Collection (`Checkout.tsx`)

### UPI QR Payment Flow
-   [âœ…] Dynamic QR Code Generation & Display (`UpiQRCode.tsx`)
-   [âœ…] Integration into Checkout (`PaymentMethods.tsx`)
-   [âœ…] Simulated Payment Status Monitoring & UI Feedback (`PaymentMethods.tsx`)
-   [âœ…] Simulated 10-Minute Wait & Dummy Tracking Orchestration

### Credit Card Payment Flow
-   [âœ…] Card Details Form & Validation (`CreditCardForm.tsx`)
-   [âœ…] ZIP Code Validation & Address Correction Workflow (Structure with session storage persistence)
    -   [ðŸ”²] Backend ZIP validation logic (if required beyond demo)
-   [âœ…] OTP Verification (Dummy OTP logic)
-   [âœ…] Transaction Pending & 10-Minute Countdown (`CreditCardForm.tsx`)
-   [âœ…] Dummy Tracking Orchestration (`Checkout.tsx`)

### Order Finalization
-   [âœ…] Order Confirmation Display (`OrderSuccess.tsx`)
-   [âœ…] Order Tracking Display (`OrderTracking.tsx` - Data flow implemented)
-   [âœ…] Order Placement: Calling `createOrderCF` from `Checkout.tsx` (Structure with mock fallback complete)

## Next Steps & Priorities

1.  **Firebase Client SDK Setup & Live Integration**: 
    *   Ensure `src/lib/firebaseClient.ts` is correctly initialized by the user. (**User Action**)
    *   Verify deployed Cloud Function names and update `httpsCallable` references. (**User Action Post-Deployment**)
    *   Ensure `useSiteSettings` hook correctly fetches and provides live UPI ID.
2.  **Refine Frontend Simulations & Placeholders**:
    *   Implement robust UPI payment status monitoring in `PaymentMethods.tsx` (currently basic simulation). (**Next Focus**)
    *   Address any remaining TODOs for backend ZIP validation if required.
    *   Ensure `CreditCardForm.tsx` correctly handles its internal 10-min wait before `onPaymentComplete` (verify timing and UX).
    *   Refine dummy tracking data flow for `OrderTracking.tsx`.
3.  **Connect Core E-commerce Flows**: Ensure all user-facing flows are robustly connected to live Cloud Functions after setup.
4.  **Firebase Live Testing**: Deploy backend, test thoroughly with live frontend calls.
5.  **Complete Core Admin Panel UIs**: Polish and ensure full functionality.
6.  **Comprehensive E2E Testing**.
7.  **Address UI/UX Refinements & Design Principles** (Accessibility, etc.).

_Current Focus: Checkout Upsell Display integrated. Next: Refine UPI payment status monitoring in `PaymentMethods.tsx`._
