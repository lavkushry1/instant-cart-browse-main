# Implementation Status

This document outlines the current implementation status of features based on the defined project requirements, particularly the detailed e-commerce flow with custom payments.

## Overview

...

## User-Facing E-commerce Flow

...

### UPI QR Payment Flow
-   [âœ…] Dynamic QR Code Generation & Display (`UpiQRCode.tsx` component created)
-   [âœ…] Integration of `UpiQRCode.tsx` into Checkout Payment Step (`PaymentMethods.tsx` updated)
-   [âœ…] Payment Status Monitoring & UI Feedback Refinement (Simulated with distinct states, messages, and countdown in `PaymentMethods.tsx`)
-   [âœ…] 10-Minute Wait & Dummy Tracking Display Orchestration (10-min wait simulated in `PaymentMethods.tsx`; `Checkout.tsx` handles transition to success/tracking post-submission)

### Credit Card Payment Flow
-   [âœ…] Card Details Collection Form (`CreditCardForm.tsx` - structure exists)
-   [âœ…] Client-Side Card Validation (Assumed within `CreditCardForm.tsx`)
-   [âœ…] ZIP Code Validation & Address Correction Workflow:
    -   [ðŸ”²] Backend ZIP validation logic (if not purely client-side for demo)
    -   [âœ…] Redirection to Address Correction Form (`AddressCorrection.tsx` - structure exists)
    -   [âœ…] Card detail persistence & pre-fill after correction (`CreditCardForm.tsx` saves/loads from session storage; `PaymentMethods.tsx` manages prefill state; `Checkout.tsx` handles address update callback)
-   [âœ…] OTP Verification Step (Frontend UI in `CreditCardForm.tsx` - dummy OTP logic)
-   [âœ…] Transaction Pending Status & 10-Minute Countdown (`CreditCardForm.tsx` correctly handles internal wait before `onPaymentComplete`)
-   [âœ…] **Dummy Tracking Display Orchestration** (After 10-min wait - `Checkout.tsx` handles transition to success/tracking after `onPaymentComplete` is called by `CreditCardForm.tsx` - **Verified / No Change Needed**)

...

## Next Steps & Priorities

1.  **Frontend Implementation for Custom Payment Flows**: Completed for core UPI and Credit Card flows (pending real backend ZIP validation and more robust UPI status check if not simulated).
2.  **Admin Payment Configuration UI**: Frontend for admin to set UPI ID (and fetch it in `PaymentMethods`). (**Current Focus**)
3.  **Firebase Live Integration & Testing**: Deploy backend, test thoroughly, connect frontend.
4.  **Complete Core Admin Panel UIs**.
5.  **Comprehensive Testing**.
6.  **Address UI/UX Refinements & Design Principles**.
