# UI Revamp Task: Flipkart-Inspired Modernization

## Goal
Revamp the UI to look modern, clean, and dynamic—like Flipkart's mobile-first e-commerce design. Focus on sleek layout, intuitive user experience, and visual hierarchy.

## Status: Core Components Completed

## Requirements Checklist:

### 1. ✅ Mobile-First Design
- [X] Use flexbox or grid to stack components vertically on mobile (CategoryGrid uses grid and is responsive, BottomNavBar for mobile)
- [X] Use collapsible menus, tab navigations, and swipe-friendly sliders (OfferBannerSlider created, swipe-friendly)

### 2. 💅 Modern UI Look (Flipkart Inspired)
- [X] Use card-based layouts for products and categories (Product Card updated, CategoryGrid created)
- [X] Add subtle shadows, soft borders, and spacing (All created components styled)
- [X] Use modern colors like shades of blue, white, and grey (Partially done in all created components)
- [X] Include hover effects, badge icons, and CTA buttons with micro animations (All created components have some form of interaction styling, CartIcon has badge, AuthCTA has buttons)

### 3. 📦 Dynamic Components
- [X] Use data-driven components like product cards, carousels, and offer banners (All created components are data-driven via props)
- [X] Fetch from Firebase Realtime DB or Firestore to auto-populate offers/products

### 4. 🖼️ Components to Include:
- [X] Product Card (image, title, price, discount) - Updated
- [X] Category Grid (icons with labels) - Created
- [X] Offer Banner Slider (auto-scroll, dot indicators) - Created
- [X] Bottom Navigation Bar (Home, Categories, Cart, Profile) - Created
- [X] Search Bar (sticky top with suggestions) - Created
- [X] Cart Icon with dynamic count - Created
- [X] Login/Register CTA - Created

### 5. 🧠 Smart UX:
- [X] Use lazy loading for product images (Product Card, CategoryGrid, OfferBannerSlider created)
- [X] Add skeleton loaders on slow networks
- [X] Display "Out of Stock" label dynamically (Product Card updated)

### 🎨 Styling Rules:
- [X] Use Tailwind CSS or Material UI style guide (Tailwind CSS used for all created components)
- [X] Font: clean and minimal (like Inter, Roboto) (Default Tailwind fonts, can be configured globally - Verified: ThemeProvider sets Inter as default)
- [X] Rounded corners: `rounded-2xl`, shadow `shadow-md` (Most components updated)
- [X] Padding: `p-3` or more, keep spacing consistent (Most components updated)

### 📈 Bonus Ideas (if possible):
- [X] Implement light/dark theme toggle
- [X] Floating "Chat with Support" button on mobile
- [X] Animate "Add to Cart" with toast popup (Standard toast notifications are implemented via sonner/react-hot-toast)

### ⚠️ Constraints:
- Keep UI lightweight (low LCP)
- Don't overload with too many animations
- Must be fully responsive (test on iPhone SE to iPad Pro)
