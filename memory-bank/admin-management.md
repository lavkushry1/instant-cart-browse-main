## Offer Management System

The Offer Management System allows administrators to create, update, and manage promotional offers that apply to specific products or the entire store.

**Status:** 
- Admin Offer Panel UI (`src/pages/Admin/Offers.tsx`) enhanced, route `/admin/offers` added.
- `offerService.ts` structured for Firebase Firestore CRUD operations.
- `OfferContext.tsx` created and `OfferProvider` integrated into `src/App.tsx`.
- `ProductCard.tsx` updated for dynamic pricing.
- `Cart.tsx` updated for dynamic totals and applied offer display.
- `Checkout.tsx` updated to calculate and pass offer-adjusted totals.
- **`OrderSummary.tsx` (within Checkout) has been updated to display the detailed pricing breakdown including original subtotal, total applied discounts (promotions), and a list of applied offer names. The final total reflects all these adjustments.**

**Frontend Offer Integration Complete (Pending Real Data & Testing).**

Next steps: 
1.  **Firebase Integration**: Implement actual Firebase setup and uncomment/complete Firestore logic in `offerService.ts` for CRUD operations on offers.
2.  **Thorough Testing**: Test the entire offer lifecycle: creation in admin, application on product pages, cart calculations, and checkout totals across various offer types (product, category, store-wide, conditional), priorities, and validity periods.
3.  Refine UI for applied offers (e.g., more detailed messages, offer conditions display if needed).
4.  Consider edge cases and advanced offer stacking/combination rules if required by business logic.

### Offer Management Workflow

1.  **Admin Creates/Edits Offer**: Via "Manage Offers" tab, saved to Firestore.
2.  **Frontend Fetches Offers**: `OfferProvider` loads offers.
3.  **Product Display**: `ProductCard.tsx` shows offer-adjusted prices.
4.  **Cart Calculation**: `Cart.tsx` uses `useOffers()` for dynamic totals and lists applied offers.
5.  **Checkout**: `Checkout.tsx` recalculates totals. `OrderSummary.tsx` displays the original subtotal, promotion discounts, tax, shipping, the list of applied offers, and the final grand total.

## Implementation Notes

- The fidelity of the `OrderSummary.tsx` in displaying the price breakdown (original price, discounts, final price) is key for user trust during checkout.
- Testing with various offer combinations and conditions is critical before deploying.
